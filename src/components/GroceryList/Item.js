// it should explain things better, but i'm not sure if i have a better name for it. Maybe FullDepartmentData or DepartmentDataFull
// and we'll be able to have a short department data as well, if we need it

// @TODO this item has an old approach that we have, when we generate a lists.
// right now we have a RenderItem at lists, as component, related to items.
// so maybe we should update this component. not sure right now, don't remember about where we using it
